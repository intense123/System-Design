## Introduction

System design is a crucial aspect of software development, and this repository serves as my learning hub to understand the intricacies of low-level system design. Here, I explore various concepts, implement code snippets, and document theoretical knowledge to solidify my understanding.

## Learning Path

I've structured my learning path to cover fundamental concepts before diving into more complex topics. The progression includes:

- Basics of System Architecture
- Memory Management
- File Systems
- Networking Basics
- Multithreading and Concurrency
- Design Patterns
- ...

Feel free to explore each section to understand my journey and grasp the concepts I've encountered.

## Folder Structure

- `01_basics/`: Basic concepts and foundational knowledge.
- `02_memory_management/`: Understanding memory allocation and management.
- `03_file_systems/`: Implementation and theory related to file systems.
- `04_networking/`: Exploring networking basics and protocols.
- `05_multithreading/`: Code snippets and resources on multithreading and concurrency.
- ...

Each folder contains code implementations, explanatory documents, and relevant resources related to the respective topic.
