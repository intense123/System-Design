Library Management System Problem Statement
Develop a library system capable of managing diverse types of library items, such as books, CDs, and DVDs. Each library item is characterized by the following attributes:

Title: The title of the item.
Unique Identifier: A distinct identifier for each library item.
Type-Specific Property: Different item types (e.g., books, CDs, DVDs) have a specific property (e.g., author for books).
The primary functionalities of the system include:

Check Out Library Items: Allow users to check out items by providing the unique identifier of the item they wish to borrow. The system should update the availability status of the item accordingly.

Calculate Late Fees: Implement a late fee calculation mechanism based on the type of library item. Different item types may have distinct late fee structures (e.g., books incurring $0.25 per day, CDs incurring $0.50 per day).

Determine Total Value: Provide a function to calculate the total value of all items in the library. The value of each item is determined by its type-specific property (e.g., market value for books, artist popularity for CDs).
